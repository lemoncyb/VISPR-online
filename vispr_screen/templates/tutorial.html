        <h3>1. Overview of home page </h3>
        <p>VISPR-online supports three popular CRISPR screening analysis tools, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25476604" target="_blank">MAGeCK</a>, 
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27083490/" target="_blank">BAGEL</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674557/" target="_blank">JACKS</a>. 
            First, you need to select which tool's result file to upload on the home page.If you don't have any result files, you can download the test data by clicking the 
            download link, or click the link to load demo and explore VISPR-online. To upload files, you need to follow the steps on the left side 
            of the home page.If you want to continue analyzing these result files the next time you open a web page, you need to choose to save the 
            session and save the session number.When you have the previous session number, you can click load session and enter the session number 
            to resume the session.

        <h3>2. Steps to upload files</h3>
        <p>Next, upload the file corresponding to each step. The asterisk indicates that the file must be uploaded. If you don't know the format of 
           the file name, you can hover over the steps to upload the file to view the file name format. The function of each sample file can refer to the README.txt. 
           After uploading the file, you can choose whether to save the session to the server. Finally, click the submit button to jump to the Result pages.

        <h3>3. Input the session number to explore the results.</h3>
        <p>If you have a session number, you can click load session to input the session number.After entering the session number, click the submit button to jump 
            to the last Result pages. You can also click load the demo to view the sample data.

        <h3>4. Explore cluster graph </h3>
        <p>
            After you jump to the results page, there will be results option and session number at the top of the page. When we jump to other pages, we can click the 
            results option to return to the results page.We take the test data of mageck as an example. First of all, we will see the result of the cluster graph, we 
            can choose different K values to analyze the cluster graph.

    <div>
        <h3>5.Explore tables and charts</h3>
        <p>We can click on different sample drop down boxes and select positive data or negative data. The result data will be displayed in tables and charts. First of 
            all, let's look at the functions of the table. Click the show box to select more rows to load, or click the next page at the bottom of the table. When you 
            need to find a row of data, you need to enter the corresponding target name in the search box. Click the header to sort the data in this column. Click on 
            the species name to jump to the detailed explanation page. Click the icon in the last column of the table to get show RNA counts and locations. Click the 
            tick logo to select target and highlight in p-value plot. Click the drop box in the upper right corner of the table to get more functions. Then let's look 
            at the function of gRNAs count. We can click the sample drop-down box to check the sample to be analyzed, or directly click deselect all to cancel all selection. 
            On the chart, we hold the axis to adjust the position. In the two graphs of distribution, we can click the middle of the graph to save the image locally.

        <p>If you click the icon in the upper right corner of the table, you will see some hidden functions of the table, including download table, go enrichment, show selections
            in genemania and deselect all.Perform a GO term enrichment of the currently displayed table with the GOrilla web service when you click go enrichment, and you can set 
            the maximum enrichment p-value.The page will jump to http://genemania.org/ When you click Show in GeneMANIA.
